# PowerGroup1

So far we have no ideas for the project

Put any ideas for the project in here: managmnet system, casino, ticket/reservation system, simple AI to play against in tic tac toe or checkers,

	Learning algorithms is an integral part of becoming a skilled programmer. One of the few of these algorithms is the Euclidean Algorithm. [1] “The Euclidean algorithm, also called Euclid's algorithm, is an algorithm for finding the greatest common divisor of two numbers a and b.” So, let’s say you have 9 and 3, the Greatest Common Divisor, or GCD, would be 3. 9/3=3 and  3/3=1. 

Our objective will be aimed at creating a C++-coded program that can find the GCD of any two numbers given by the user. As well, a way to find the Least Common Multiple will be included along with various similar functions. These functions will be accessible via a menu displayed to the user. This will loop until the user chooses to end the program.
